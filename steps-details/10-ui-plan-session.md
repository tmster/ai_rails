You are an AI assistant tasked with helping to plan the user interface architecture for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) based on the information provided. Your goal is to generate a list of questions and recommendations that will be used in the next prompt to create a detailed UI architecture, user journey maps, and navigation structure.

Please read the following information carefully:

<product_requirements>
#prd.md
</product_requirements>

<tech_stack>
#tech-stack.md
</tech_stack>

<models>
#models
</models>

Review the information provided, focusing on aspects relevant to user interface design. Consider the following:

1. Identify key views and screens based on product requirements and models.
2. Determine potential user flows and navigation between views, taking into account controllers capabilities.
3. Consider the UI components and interaction patterns that may be necessary for effective communication with the API.
4. Think about the responsiveness and accessibility of the interface.
5. Consider any specific UI libraries or frameworks that may be beneficial to the project.
6. Analyze how the models structure affects the UI design and data flows in the application.

Based on your analysis, generate a list of questions and recommendations. These should address any ambiguities, potential issues, or areas where more information is needed to create an effective UI architecture. Consider questions about:

1. The hierarchy and organization of views in relation to models structure
2. User flows and navigation supported by available endpoints
3. Responsiveness and adaptation to different devices
4. Accessibility and inclusivity
6. Consistency of design and user experience

The output data should have the following structure:

<ui_architecture_planning_output>
<questions>
[List your questions here, numbered]
</questions>

<recommendations>
[List your recommendations here, numbered]
</recommendations>
</ui_architecture_planning_output>

Remember that your goal is to provide a comprehensive list of questions and recommendations that will help create a robust UI architecture for the MVP, fully integrated with the available models and controllers. Focus on the clarity, relevance, and accuracy of your results. Do not include any additional comments or explanations beyond the specified output format.

Continue this process by generating new questions and recommendations based on the context provided and the user's responses until the user explicitly requests a summary.

Remember to focus on clarity, relevance, and accuracy in your results. Do not include any additional comments or explanations beyond the specified output format.

### Main Problem

Coordinating meeting times between multiple parties often leads to long email threads and scheduling conflicts. EasyMeet leverages automation and user preferences to streamline the process of finding mutually available meeting slots.

### Minimum Feature Set

- Creating, viewing, editing, and deleting meeting invitations
- Simple user account system to associate users with their meetings and availability
- User profile page for saving availability preferences and working hours
- Automated scheduling assistant that suggests optimal meeting times based on participant preferences

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Integration with external calendars (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Advanced notification and reminder systems
- Group scheduling with more than five participants
- Video conferencing integrations


### Success Criteria

- 90% of users have completed their availability preferences in their profile
- 80% of meeting invitations result in a confirmed meeting within 48 hours

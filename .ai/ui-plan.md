Let me analyze the requirements and create a UI architecture plan. I'll document my thought process before presenting the final architecture.

<ui_architecture_planning>

1. Key Requirements Analysis:
- User registration and authentication (FR-001)
- Meeting invitation management (FR-002)
- Profile management (FR-003)
- Multi-channel invitation delivery (FR-004)
- Secure invitation access and confirmation (FR-005)
- Basic automated scheduling (FR-006)

2. Main API Endpoints (based on models):
- Users: CRUD operations for user profiles
- Invitations: CRUD for meeting invitations
- InvitationParticipants: Managing participants
- TimeSlots: Managing meeting time slots
- Confirmations: Handling attendance confirmations
- Deliveries: Managing invitation delivery channels

3. Required Views:
- Authentication views (login, registration, password reset)
- Dashboard/Home
- Invitation creation/edit form
- Invitation list view
- Invitation detail view (organizer)
- Invitation detail view (participant)
- Profile management
- Settings page

4. User Journey Analysis:
Primary flow:
1. User registers/logs in
2. Views dashboard
3. Creates new invitation
4. Adds participants and time slots
5. Sends invitations
6. Participants receive links
7. Participants view and confirm attendance

Key considerations:
- Mobile-first approach required
- Must support multiple delivery channels
- Security through secure tokens
- Clear confirmation workflow

5. Navigation Requirements:
- Sidebar-based navigation (from UI plan session)
- Mobile-responsive design
- Clear separation between authenticated and public views
- Easy access to core functions

6. Security Considerations:
- Token-based invitation access
- Authentication requirements for sensitive operations
- Clear permission boundaries between organizer and participant views
- Secure handling of personal information

7. Accessibility Needs:
- Basic ARIA implementation
- Clear navigation structure
- Consistent heading hierarchy
- Keyboard navigation support

8. Component Requirements:
- Modal dialogs for critical actions
- Forms for data input
- Lists for invitations and time slots
- Navigation sidebar
- Confirmation dialogs
- Status indicators
- Time displays

9. Edge Cases:
- Handling expired invitations
- Managing declined invitations
- Dealing with delivery failures
- Handling timezone differences
- Managing concurrent edits

10. Integration Points:
- Email delivery system
- SMS delivery system
- LinkedIn messaging system
- Analytics tracking
- Time zone handling

This analysis forms the basis for the UI architecture I'll now document.

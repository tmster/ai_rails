    The product's primary functional requirements include the ability to create, send, edit, and delete meeting invitations. The process is centered on ensuring that freelancers receive invitations through email, SMS, and LinkedIn, select an appropriate time slot, and confirm their participation via a provided link.

    **Key User Stories and Usage Paths:**
    - A freelancer receives a meeting invitation through one of the designated communication channels.
    - The freelancer clicks on the invitation link to access meeting details.
    - The freelancer confirms their attendance, with the system recording the confirmation time.

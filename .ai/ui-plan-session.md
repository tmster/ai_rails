    1. The main focus is on the invitation view for guests, displaying information about the inviter and the conversation channel (without the green icon in the guest view).
    3. Navigation will use a sidebar that includes links to the invitation list, profile management (CRUD panel), and logout, with the possibility of additional sections.
    4. Modal dialogs will be used for deletion and sending invitations, showing detailed information such as email, first and last names.
    5. The invitation view should also display extra details like which users have confirmed and the remaining time until the meeting.
    6. The interface will be developed using a mobile-first approach with basic ARIA for accessibility.
    7. The UI will rely on controller-provided data rather than a dedicated API, with future potential integration of dynamic updates via Hotwire Turbo Streams.

  <matched_recommendations>
    1. Utilize standard RubyUI components (Phlex and TailwindCSS) for consistency in the interface.
    2. Develop the invitation view to clearly show key details (date, time, inviter, conversation channel, confirmation status, and meeting countdown).
    3. Implement a sidebar with links to main sections (invitation list, profile management, logout), following a CRUD-oriented panel.
    4. Use modal windows modeled after Bootstrap for actions like deletion and sending invitations, including detailed information about the operation.
    5. Maintain a mobile-first design approach with basic ARIA attributes to support minimal accessibility.
    6. Continue using controller-supplied data for UI state management, with the option to integrate Hotwire Turbo Streams in the future.

  <ui_architecture_planning_summary>
    The discussion has defined clear UI architecture requirements for the MVP. The primary feature is the invitation view for guests, which must display clear details of the inviter and the communication channel (excluding the green icon for guests). Login and registration screens are to mirror the Devise interface using RubyUI components.

    Navigation will be handled through a sidebar containing links to the invitation list, profile management, and logout, with potential for additional sections as the CRUD panel evolves. Modal dialogs modeled after Bootstrap will manage critical actions such as deletion and sending invitations, where detailed user information (e.g., email, first and last name) is displayed.

    The invitation view will be enhanced to include confirmation data and a countdown to the meeting. The design prioritizes a mobile-first approach with basic ARIA support for accessibility. At this stage, the UI leverages data populated by controllers without an explicit API integration, while leaving room for future dynamic updates via Hotwire Turbo Streams.

  <unresolved_issues>
    1. The exact layout and structure for presenting additional details in the invitation view (confirmation info and meeting countdown) need to be defined.
    2. Specific design guidelines for modal dialogs regarding the content and presentation details for deletion and sending operations.
    3. Future enhancements in accessibility features and the integration of dynamic updates using Turbo Streams.
